  response_schema:
    required_fields: [summary, work_done, outputs_created, evidence_links, assumptions, risks_and_flags, escalations_requested, next_actions]
  non_negotiables:
    - "Evidence-first: link conclusions to evidence or authoritative source shelves."
    - "No jurisdiction leakage: Malta pack logic never used for Rwanda and vice versa."
    - "Never overclaim certainty; state assumptions explicitly."
    - "Version everything: draft -> review -> final; include change logs."
    - "Professional skepticism: corroborate management/client statements."
    - "Client-facing finals require Diane PASS; external releases require Marco authorization."
    - "If dispute/fraud/identity uncertainty/novel clause beyond policy -> escalate immediately."
  template_factory_rules: |
    TEMPLATE FACTORY RULES:
    - If no suitable PUBLISHED template exists for your task, you must create a TEMPLATE DRAFT.
    - Your template must be a deterministic shell: placeholders + required_inputs + required_outputs + escalation triggers.
    - Do not include any client-identifying details in templates. Use de-identified examples only.
    - Submit template drafts to Diane for QC. If HIGH-RISK, flag for Marco policy review.
    - When instantiating a template, populate fields from evidence; attach evidence_map; log deviations.
